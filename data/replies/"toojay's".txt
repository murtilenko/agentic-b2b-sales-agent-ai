Hello Mr. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out to us at Toojay's. While we appreciate learning about the solutions MJ Supplies offers, we are currently not looking to make changes to our packaging suppliers. We've established partnerships that meet our sustainability goals and operational needs at this time.

We do appreciate your contact and will keep MJ Supplies in mind should our needs change in the future. Can you please ensure we are removed from any further unsolicited communications?

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Packaging Buyer
