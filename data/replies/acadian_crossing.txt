Hello Mr. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out to us and sharing information about MJ Supplies and your product offerings. While your introduction to Acadian Crossing suggests a potential alignment, we typically conduct thorough due diligence before considering new suppliers, especially unsolicited ones.

To gain a clearer understanding, could you please provide more details on your company’s track record in sustainable packaging for the food industry? Specifically, I’m interested in any case studies or references from clients with similar requirements to ours. Additionally, could you share more about your production facilities and any certifications that affirm your sustainability claims?

Lastly, while your attachment outlines various products, a clearer understanding of your pricing structure, lead times, and minimum order quantities would be essential for any further consideration.

Looking forward to your detailed response.

Best regards,
