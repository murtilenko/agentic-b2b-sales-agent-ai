Hello MR. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out to the Fiori Bruno Pasta Team. We are always on the lookout for innovative packaging solutions, especially those that align with our sustainability goals. However, we have a few concerns and would appreciate some clarification.

You mentioned the Boardsio Retail Baking Mix Box and the Octo Oven Safe Containers. Could you provide more detailed specifications on how these products compare to industry standards in terms of sustainability and durability? Additionally, do you have any case studies or references from other food industry clients who have successfully used these products?

Before we consider moving forward, it would be helpful to review some third-party certifications or test results that verify the performance and sustainability claims of your products. Understanding the timeline for delivery and your standard pricing structure would also be beneficial.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
