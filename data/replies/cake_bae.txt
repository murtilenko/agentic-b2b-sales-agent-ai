Dear Mr. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out and for providing details about MJ Supplies' sustainable packaging options. It's always interesting to see innovative solutions in the packaging industry.

However, before proceeding further, I would appreciate some additional information to better understand the value proposition. Could you provide references from other food industry clients who have successfully implemented your solutions? Additionally, it would be beneficial to know more about the specific sustainability certifications your products hold and any third-party verifications.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
