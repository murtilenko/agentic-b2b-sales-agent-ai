Hello Mr. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out and introducing MJ Supplies' sustainable packaging solutions. We are indeed focused on expanding Brotelli Pasta Bar responsibly, and your eco-friendly options sound promising.

I am particularly interested in learning more about the Freskboard medium containers and the Octo Octo compostable containers. Could you provide more details on their pricing, minimum order quantities, and lead times for delivery? Additionally, it would be helpful to understand how your products compare in terms of durability and insulation properties.

I appreciate the offer for a sample kit; it would be beneficial for us to evaluate the quality firsthand. Please let me know how we can arrange this.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
