Hello Mr. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing information about MJ Supplies' packaging products. We appreciate your interest in collaborating with Buettner Global Services.

At this time, we are not looking to partner with new suppliers, as we are currently satisfied with our existing packaging solutions. Additionally, our procurement schedule for this year is already set, and we do not foresee any changes in our supplier lineup in the near term.

Should our needs change, we will certainly consider revisiting this opportunity. Thank you for understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Procurement Manager
