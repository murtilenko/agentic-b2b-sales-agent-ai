Hello MR. Robot,

Thank you for reaching out and for the kind words about Z's Catering & BBQ. Weâ€™re always on the lookout for packaging solutions that align with our commitment to quality and sustainability.

Before we proceed, could you provide some references from other clients in the catering industry who have worked with MJ Supplies? Additionally, we'd like to see some more detailed specifications on your Octo Octo Oven Safe and Compostable Containers. Are these products certified by any environmental standards?

Understanding the timeline and fulfillment capabilities is crucial for us. Could you also provide some information regarding your delivery lead times and pricing structure?

Looking forward to your response.

Best,  
Scott
