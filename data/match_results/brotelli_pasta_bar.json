  "raw_gpt4o_output": "Based on the provided company description and website content, it appears that the company is involved in online retail and possibly e-commerce, with a focus on a wide range of consumer goods. However, there is no direct mention of pasta or food-related products, which makes it challenging to directly align the product catalog with the company's business. Nonetheless, I will select products that could potentially fit a broad e-commerce platform or retail business:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"brand\": \"Boardsio\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Retail Coffee Box\",\n    \"reason\": \"Eco-friendly packaging suitable for retail goods, aligning with a broad e-commerce platform.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"brand\": \"Boardsio\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Retail Protein Powder Box\",\n    \"reason\": \"Versatile packaging for powdered goods, fitting a diverse product offering in an online retail setting.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"brand\": \"Freskboard\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Small Container\",\n    \"reason\": \"Suitable for take-out or delivery services, which could be part of an e-commerce platform's offerings.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"brand\": \"Octo\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Compostable Container\",\n    \"reason\": \"Environmentally friendly packaging option for foodservice applications, aligning with sustainable practices.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"brand\": \"Paperbake\",\n    \"product_name\": \"Baking Tray\",\n    \"reason\": \"Recyclable baking trays could be relevant for a company involved in selling kitchen or baking products.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThese selections are based on the assumption that the company might be involved in a broad range of retail or e-commerce activities, potentially including food-related products or sustainable packaging solutions."
