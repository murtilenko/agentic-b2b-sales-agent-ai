Hello Condado Tacos Team,

I hope this message finds you well! I’m reaching out from MJ Supplies, where we specialize in creating sustainable packaging solutions tailored for the food industry. We’ve taken a look at Condado Tacos and your vibrant approach to serving up delicious tacos, burritos, and more across the Midwest, and we think our products could complement your offerings perfectly.

One of our standout products is the Fastfood Food Tray. These trays are ideal for your dine-in service, allowing you to neatly present multiple items like your tacos and burritos together. They’re not just functional but also add a neat, organized touch to your vibrant dining experience.

For your take-out and delivery options, our Freskboard Medium Container would be a great fit. These containers are excellent for ensuring that your tacos and burritos reach your customers just as deliciously as they left your kitchen. Plus, they offer a sustainable and sturdy solution for your on-the-go offerings.

Additionally, the Octo Grease Barrier Container could be a game-changer for your greasier items. This packaging is designed to prevent leaks, keeping your take-out orders fresh and intact from kitchen to customer.

I’ve attached our product catalog for a closer look at what we offer. We’d love to explore how we can support your packaging needs and contribute to your mission of providing a unique dining experience. Feel free to connect with us or take a glance at our catalog.

Looking forward to the possibility of working together!

Warm regards,
